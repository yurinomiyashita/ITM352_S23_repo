/*
    Implement the above algorithm in JS to determine the day of the week for ANY date. Start by defining variables day for the day a number from 1-31, month for the month (a String) “January”, “February”, etc., year a number 1900-2099 for the year
    Use your birth date as a test case.
    Use parseInt() or Math.floor() to get the divisor and drop the remainder
    To handle step 1 use if or a ternary operator
    Make an object monthKey from the month-key table and use it for Step 6
    Use the modulus operator % to get the remainder in Step 7
    Make an array of days of the week strings to convert Step 7 into the day as per the day number table
    Output the date and and the day of week to the console.
